WHAT IS CROSSFIT?

DESIGN

This project was created to provide information on what CrossFit is and to provide sample workouts - WODs - to gain interest. The audience for this project is anyone who is wanting more information on what CrossFit is and/or who is wanting to be more healthy and fit in general. By providing sample WODs and terms to know, someone can go into any CrossFit class and already have some background knowledge on what to expect.

FEATURES

Navigation Bar

Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home Page, Terms and Wods, and Contact Us page to allow easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

The Landing Page

The landing page is broken up into three sections. The first section provides a defintion of what CrossFit is so that the user can understand what elements are include in CrossFit. The image to the right, is of Katrin Davíðsdóttir, who has been a winner twice of the CrossFit Games. 
The second section is an explanation of an important concept to understand - WOD. It is essential in CrossFit to understand what this means, as this is the basis of all workouts that one will accomplish. The image here is of a women doing a back squat to help show excersises that are part of WODs.
The third section is a list of benefits that one will aquire if he/she joins the CrossFit community. Again, another basic movement for the image to demonstrate exerceises that will be part of your normal workout.
I end with "Want to Learn More" hoping that the user will be intrigued and want to learn more and therefore click the links at the bottom of the page and my other pages to want to learn more.
I specifically have chosen all female atheletes here as I want to promote more involement of female athletes in general. This is due to most of media coverage in sports and of athletes in general being male dominated. I want women to know that this sport is for them too. They don't need to think that it's too tough - that it is for all. It is also for all levels of fitness as anyone can do CrossFit and scale the workouts if necessary.

Terms & WODs page

I start with a table of terms to know on the left. I feel that it is important to understand some terms because if a person will join a CrossFit class, he/she will not feel so lost if they don't understand the terminology. The terms provide some basic definitons that a person will experience in any CrossFit class. On the right, I again provide an image of Katrin Davíðsdóttir
